        Without censorship or restrictions.

        Grin is designed for the decades to come, not just tomorrow. Grin wants to be usable by everyone — regardless of borders, culture, skills or access.

    <p>
      Grin is a privacy-protecting digital currency built openly by developers distributed all over the world.

      Grin has no amounts and no addresses. Transactions can be trivially aggregated. To hide where a newly created transaction comes from, it gets relayed privately among peers before it is publicly announced.

      Grin is not controlled by any company, foundation or individual. The coin distribution is designed to be as fair as is known to be possible, with an emission of 1 GRIN per second.

      MimbleWimble leverages cryptography to allow most of the past transaction data to be removed. This guarantees Grin won't collapse under its own weight in the long term.

          Grin is launched fairly — free of ICO,
          pre-mine or founder’s reward. We rely on donations to keep working on
          the project. Support the movement by purchasing some <a href="https://tmgox.com/">merch</a> or making a
